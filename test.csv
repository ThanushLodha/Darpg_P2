On December 31st, 2022, Mr. Govindan was summoned to the Attur Town Police Station to present self-attested copies of Aadhar and Voter ID for himself and his wife, Manimekalai Kumar, along with originals for verification.

Mr. Govindan believes the police officer did not comprehend that his Aadhar Card was submitted for proof of Date of Birth and Voter ID for proof of Present Address. In the application, he had given Salem as his permanent address (per Aadhar Card) and Attur as his work address (per Voter ID), where he wants the passport to be issued.

The officer allegedly questioned the different addresses on the documents and hinted at the need for police verification in Salem. He also requested a copy of the expired passport, which had a New Delhi address.

Mr. Govindan explained that he moved to Salem in 2015 and established his business in Attur the same year. He has resided in both locations for almost eight years and possesses a PAN Card with his Salem address and a Driving License with his Attur address.

He emphasizes that the difference in addresses between the Aadhar Card and Voter ID should not affect the passport issuance, and that laws and regulations should be uniformly interpreted. He also questions why the police officer did not physically verify his address and expresses dissatisfaction with the officer's prolonged absence and lack of attention to those waiting for verification.

They also attached forged signatures of the residents.

The Allocation of Business rules mandate that these standards be set by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) in consultation with the Ministry of Health. However, neither DoPT nor the Ministry of Health has appointed anyone to handle this matter.

The Indian Railways, designated as the nodal ministry for this issue, has taken actions that contradict the allocation of business rules. The railways did not consult DoPT or the Ministry of Health in setting medical standards, particularly for the 2009 examination. Despite DoPT's clarification that it has not established specific standards for diabetes mellitus, the railways claim a blanket ban on service allocation to candidates disqualified on this basis.

Both DoPT and the Ministry of Health have stated that the railways failed to consult or obtain approval for the medical standards. The railways' argument that the Ministry of Health and DGHS could only act upon referral is invalid, as the railways have not made such a referral.

Subject: Grievance Regarding False and Defamatory Allegations by Head of Department

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my grievance against the false and defamatory allegations made by Dr. A. K. Jain, Head of Department of Computer Engineering at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology.

On 15/12/2022, Dr. Jain falsely accused me of plagiarism in front of other faculty members and students during a departmental meeting. Despite my repeated attempts to defend myself, he remained adamant and refused to withdraw his accusations.

These allegations have not only tarnished my reputation but have also adversely affected my career prospects. I have been collaborating with external organizations for research projects, and these accusations have put my collaborations at risk.

I have always maintained the highest ethical standards in my research and teaching. The allegations made by Dr. Jain are baseless and malicious. I strongly believe that he is attempting to defame me and undermine my credibility.

I request you to conduct an impartial investigation into this matter and take appropriate action against Dr. Jain for his false and defamatory allegations. I also request that my reputation be restored, and I be compensated for the damage caused to my career prospects.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,

MINHA/E/2023/0001581,4789,"Mr. Harpal Singh Rana, President of the People's Secretariat, filed a grievance to the Union Home Secretary regarding the non-recognition of the Right to Information (RTI) Act under the Consumer Protection Act.

The Consumer Protection Act, which came into effect on 20th July 2020, aims to protect consumer rights by ensuring they receive the right quantity and quality of goods.

Despite efforts to include the RTI Act under the Consumer Protection Act, authorities have been reluctant to do so, arguing that the RTI Act does not fall under the scope of consumer law.

However, the grievance argues that any service or product purchased, including information requested under the RTI Act, constitutes consumer activity and should therefore be subject to the Consumer Protection Act.

The grievance requests clarification on whether the RTI Act falls under the Consumer Protection Act. This clarity will eliminate confusion, empower citizens with the correct information, and enable them to exercise their consumer rights effectively.

MINHA/E/2023/0001624,4789,"**Summary of Grievance:**

The grievance highlights the issue of widespread vacant positions within government departments, particularly in crucial departments such as education, healthcare, police, transportation, and judiciary. This shortage of personnel has severe consequences:

* **Public Service Impact:** Citizens in remote areas face limited access to essential services like healthcare and education.
* **Increased Workload:** Existing staff are burdened with excessive workloads, leading to potential delays and inefficiencies.
* **Resource Misuse:** Budgetary allocations for programs remain unspent due to lack of personnel, depriving citizens of critical resources.
* **Corruption Risk:** The shortage of staff increases the likelihood of corruption as there is less oversight and accountability.
* **Inadequate Staffing Assessment:** The government has not adequately assessed the actual need for personnel in various departments for over a decade, contributing to the staffing shortage.

The grievance urges the Central Home Secretary to address the issue by:

* Establishing clear guidelines for determining appropriate staffing levels
* Regularly reviewing and adjusting staffing levels to meet changing needs
* Implementing mechanisms to expedite the filling of vacant positions
* Addressing any underlying issues, such as corruption or legal challenges, that hinder timely recruitment

आयुष्मान भारत योजना पात्र नागरिकों को स्वास्थ्य सहायता प्रदान करने के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण पहल है। हालांकि, यह बताया गया है कि देश भर के राज्यों में योजना के संबंध में अनियमितताएं और भ्रष्टाचार हो रहा है।

पात्र व्यक्तियों को लाभ प्राप्त करने में कठिनाई का सामना करना पड़ रहा है, जबकि अपात्र व्यक्ति भ्रष्टाचार के माध्यम से योजना का लाभ उठा रहे हैं। फर्जी बिल और पैनलबद्ध अस्पतालों की संलिप्तता चिंता का विषय है।

धोखाधड़ी को रोकने के लिए गठित इकाई और दिशानिर्देशों को प्रभावी ढंग से लागू करने में राज्य सरकारें विफल रही हैं। यह योजना के सबसे वंचित लाभार्थियों के अधिकारों का हनन है।

इस भ्रष्टाचार को दूर करने और सुनिश्चित करने के लिए सख्त कार्रवाई की आवश्यकता है कि योजना के वास्तविक पात्रों को लाभ मिले।

The recruitment process for government jobs in India is not being centrally managed by the National Recruitment Agency, leading to irregularities. The government should establish a separate institution to handle recruitment, allowing for simultaneous applications for different departments and positions.

Currently, applicants are required to submit multiple applications and pay fees, resulting in excessive revenue for the government. This practice should be abolished, and applications should be made free of charge. Additionally, the government should standardize the advertising of job openings and improve the transparency of the recruitment process.

For example, in Rajasthan, millions of rupees were collected from application fees from 2009 to 2018 alone. The repeated application and examination process has caused financial burden for job seekers, who often fail to secure employment despite significant investment.

MINHA/E/2023/0002792,4789,"**सारांश:**

इस शिकायत पत्र में देश के वन क्षेत्रों और पार्कों में पर्यावरण को शुद्ध करने वाले ऑक्सीजन छोड़ने वाले पेड़ों की कमी पर चिंता व्यक्त की गई है। इस कमी के कारण प्रदूषण में वृद्धि हुई है, जो न केवल मनुष्यों के लिए बल्कि सभी जीवों के लिए खतरा है।

लेखक आग्रह करता है कि सरकार जंगलों और पार्कों में पीपल, नीम, बरगद, अर्जुन, अशोक और जामुन जैसे ऑक्सीजन देने वाले पेड़ों को लगाने की प्राथमिकता दे। इसके अतिरिक्त, घरों और अन्य क्षेत्रों में एलोवेरा, तुलसी, गिलोय जैसे औषधीय पौधों को लगाने के लिए प्रचार-प्रसार किया जाए।

सरकार को व्यक्तिगत प्रयासों और सरकारी वृक्षारोपण कार्यक्रमों के माध्यम से ऑक्सीजन देने वाले पेड़ों को बढ़ावा देने के लिए कदम उठाने चाहिए। ऐसा करने से पर्यावरण में ऑक्सीजन का स्तर बढ़ेगा और प्रदूषण को नियंत्रण में किया जा सकेगा।
